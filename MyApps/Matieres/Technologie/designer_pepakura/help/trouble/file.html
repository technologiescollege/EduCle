		<H2>Loading 3D files
		</H2>
		<DIV class="main">
			<p>
			Pepakura Designer supports some file formats, but it may not load some files 
			properly due to the 3D software version's saving options. Try changing the 
			saving options, or convert the 3D model into another file format with other 
			software.
			<p>Pepakura Designer has great compatibility with <a href="http://www.metaseq.net/english/index.html" target="h_blankh">
					Metasequoia</a>
			and Metasequoia supports a lot of common file formats. Please try Metasequoia. 
			(Metasequoia is a 3D CG software developed by O.Mizno, and is not our 
			software.)

		<H2>Saving with EPS format</H2>
		<DIV class="main">
			<p>
			When you save data in EPS format, the texture and text information is not 
			saved. And the saved data can be loaded in Adobe Illustrator. It may not be 
			loaded into other applications properely.</DIV>
