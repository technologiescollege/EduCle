NI-CAN:  (Hex 0xBFF62206) You initialized the task for single-sample access (sample rate = 0), but you called Read or Write with number of samples greater than one.  Solutions: Change sample rate to greater than zero, Pass one as the number of samples to Read or Write.
</nierror>
<nierror code="-1074388473">
NI-CAN:  (Hex 0xBFF62207) You passed NULL for a required pointer.  Solutions: Consult the Programmer Reference to ensure that you pass valid pointers to the function.

<nierror code="-1074388472">
NI-CAN:  (Hex 0xBFF62208) Can not use Timestamped Input with a task whose channels span multiple messages.  The resulting timestamps are ambiguous for such tasks.  Solutions: Initialize a separate task for each message.
</nierror>
<nierror code="-1074388471">
NI-CAN:  (Hex 0xBFF62209) Your call to Read or Write does not match the initialized input/output mode.  For example, you called Read for a task initialized as output.  Solutions: Consult the Programmer Reference to ensure that the initialized mode matches the read/write.

<nierror code="-1074388470">
NI-CAN:  (Hex 0xBFF6220A) You set the Timeout property greater than zero, and Read of timestamped samples detected a timeout before the number of desired samples arrived.  Solutions: Set Timeout to zero to poll for available samples; Increase Timeout property.
</nierror>
<nierror code="-1074388469">
NI-CAN:  (Hex 0xBFF6220B) You did not pass an interface to Initialize, and a unique interface is not specified in MAX.  Solutions: Use MAX to assign the same default interface for all messages in the task; Pass the desired interface to Initialize.

<nierror code="-1074388464">
NI-CAN:  (Hex 0xBFF62210) You created a message for the Channel API with a data length greater than 8 bytes. The CAN protocol supports only 8 bytes messages. Larger messages require a higher-level protocol on top of CAN, such as SAE-J1939. Solutions: Configure the number of bytes per message to 8 bytes or less.
</nierror>
<nierror code="-1074388463">
NI-CAN:  (Hex 0xBFF62211) You called Read or Write with number of samples 0. You must read or write a buffer of at least one sample. Solutions: Use number of samples greater than or equal to 1.

<nierror code="1073094665">
NI-CAN:  (Hex 0x3FF62009) The data returned from this Read matches the data returned from the previous call to Read.  Solutions: If you merely want the most recent data, ignore this warning; For new data, wait for Read Avail state before calling Read.

<nierror code="1073095174">
NI-CAN:  (Hex 0x3FF62206) Your task is initialized with sample rate 0, but you Read or Write more than a single sample. Since unsampled frame transfer uses only a single sample, the additional samples are redundant. Solutions: Read or Write only one sample (single-sample modes).
